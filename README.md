# QuantumProtocol

## Description

This repository serves as a foundational framework for exploring and implementing quantum communication protocols in Python. It provides a modular and extensible environment for simulating, analyzing, and prototyping quantum key distribution (QKD), quantum teleportation, and other advanced quantum communication schemes. The aim is to facilitate research and development in quantum information science by offering a readily accessible and customizable platform for both educational and experimental purposes. This framework emphasizes clarity, efficiency, and adherence to established quantum computing principles, enabling users to delve into the intricacies of quantum communication without being bogged down by low-level implementation details.

## Features

*   **Modular Protocol Implementation:**  The framework supports the implementation of quantum communication protocols as independent modules, allowing for easy experimentation and comparison of different approaches.  Each protocol module encapsulates the quantum operations, classical communication, and security analysis specific to that protocol.

*   **Quantum State Management:** Provides robust tools for representing and manipulating quantum states, including qubits, entangled states, and mixed states, using a suitable quantum computing library (e.g., Qiskit, Cirq). Includes functionalities for state preparation, measurement, and transformation.

*   **Channel Simulation:** Simulates realistic quantum channels, including noise models such as depolarizing channel, amplitude damping channel, and phase damping channel.  This allows for the evaluation of protocol performance under realistic conditions.

*   **Security Analysis Tools:** Offers tools for analyzing the security of quantum communication protocols against various eavesdropping attacks.  This includes calculating key rates, error rates, and other relevant security metrics.

*   **Extensible Architecture:**  Designed with an extensible architecture that allows users to easily add new protocols, noise models, and security analysis tools.

## Installation

To install the QuantumProtocol framework, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/QuantumProtocol.git
    cd QuantumProtocol
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    The project depends on several Python packages, including a quantum computing library (e.g., Qiskit), NumPy, and potentially others for data analysis and visualization. A `requirements.txt` file is provided to manage these dependencies.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If you are using Qiskit as the quantum computing library, you might need to install it separately:

    ```bash
    pip install qiskit
    ```

    Ensure you have a compatible version of Python (3.7 or higher is recommended). You may also need to install `qiskit-aer` for faster simulations:

    ```bash
    pip install qiskit-aer
    ```

4.  **Verify the installation:**

    Run the example scripts in the `examples` directory to verify that the installation is successful.

## Usage

Here are some example code snippets demonstrating how to use the QuantumProtocol framework. These examples assume a basic understanding of quantum computing concepts.

**Example 1: Creating and manipulating a qubit using Qiskit (assuming Qiskit is the backend)**

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Create a Quantum Circuit with 1 qubit and 1 classical bit
qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)

# Apply a Hadamard gate to the qubit
qc.h(0)

# Measure the qubit
qc.measure([0], [0])

# Use Aer's qasm_simulator
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')

# Execute the circuit on the qasm simulator
job = execute(qc, simulator, shots=1024)

# Get the results of the execution
result = job.result()

# Get the counts
counts = result.get_counts(qc)
print("Counts:", counts)

# You can also visualize the results
# plot_histogram(counts) # Uncomment to plot a histogram (requires matplotlib)
```

**Example 2: Simulating a simple quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol (BB84 - simplified)**

```python
import random

def bb84_alice(bits):
    """Alice prepares qubits and sends them to Bob."""
    qubits = []
    bases = []
    for bit in bits:
        basis = random.randint(0, 1)  # 0 for rectilinear, 1 for diagonal
        bases.append(basis)
        if basis == 0:  # Rectilinear basis
            if bit == 0:
                qubit = 0  # |0>
            else:
                qubit = 1  # |1>
        else:  # Diagonal basis
            if bit == 0:
                qubit = 2  # |+>
            else:
                qubit = 3  # |->
        qubits.append(qubit)
    return qubits, bases

def bb84_bob(qubits):
    """Bob measures the qubits received from Alice."""
    bob_bases = [random.randint(0, 1) for _ in qubits]
    bob_bits = []
    for i, qubit in enumerate(qubits):
        if bob_bases[i] == 0:  # Rectilinear basis
            if qubit == 0:
                bob_bit = 0
            elif qubit == 1:
                bob_bit = 1
            elif qubit == 2: #incorrect basis
                bob_bit = random.randint(0,1)
            else: #incorrect basis
                bob_bit = random.randint(0,1)
        else:  # Diagonal basis
            if qubit == 2:
                bob_bit = 0
            elif qubit == 3:
                bob_bit = 1
            elif qubit == 0: #incorrect basis
                bob_bit = random.randint(0,1)
            else: #incorrect basis
                bob_bit = random.randint(0,1)
        bob_bits.append(bob_bit)
    return bob_bits, bob_bases

def key_sifting(alice_bits, alice_bases, bob_bits, bob_bases):
    """Alice and Bob compare bases and discard qubits measured in different bases."""
    key_alice = []
    key_bob = []
    for i, (alice_basis, bob_basis) in enumerate(zip(alice_bases, bob_bases)):
        if alice_basis == bob_basis:
            key_alice.append(alice_bits[i])
            key_bob.append(bob_bits[i])
    return key_alice, key_bob

# Example usage
alice_bits = [random.randint(0, 1) for _ in range(100)]
qubits, alice_bases = bb84_alice(alice_bits)
bob_bits, bob_bases = bb84_bob(qubits)
key_alice, key_bob = key_sifting(alice_bits, alice_bases, bob_bits, bob_bases)

print("Alice's Key:", key_alice[:10])  # Print first 10 bits
print("Bob's Key:", key_bob[:10])    # Print first 10 bits

#Now you would need to add error correction and privacy amplification
```

**Note:** These are simplified examples. Real-world quantum communication protocols are significantly more complex and require advanced quantum computing libraries and error correction techniques.  Replace placeholder comments with actual implementation details.
