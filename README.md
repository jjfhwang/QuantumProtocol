# QuantumProtocol

## Description

QuantumProtocol is a research and development project focused on the implementation and analysis of decentralized ledger algorithms. This repository provides a collection of Python implementations of various consensus mechanisms and distributed ledger technologies, along with tools for performance evaluation and security analysis. The goal is to provide a platform for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to explore, experiment with, and improve upon existing decentralized ledger solutions. By offering well-documented and tested implementations, QuantumProtocol aims to accelerate innovation in the field of distributed consensus and secure data management. This project explores beyond traditional blockchain approaches, including implementations inspired by quantum computing principles (though not requiring quantum hardware).

## Features

*   **Modular Consensus Implementations:** Includes implementations of several consensus algorithms, such as Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), designed for easy integration and comparison.
*   **Performance Evaluation Tools:** Provides tools for benchmarking the performance of different consensus algorithms, including metrics such as transaction throughput, latency, and energy consumption.
*   **Security Analysis Framework:** Offers a framework for analyzing the security properties of different consensus algorithms, including resistance to common attacks such as Sybil attacks, 51% attacks, and double-spending attacks.
*   **Simulation Environment:** Includes a simulation environment for testing and evaluating decentralized ledger algorithms in a controlled setting, allowing for the exploration of different network topologies and attack scenarios.
*   **Quantum-Inspired Consensus:** Explores novel consensus mechanisms that leverage concepts from quantum computing, such as quantum key distribution and quantum entanglement, to enhance security and efficiency. (Note: This does not require actual quantum computers to run)

## Installation

To install QuantumProtocol and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/QuantumProtocol.git
    cd QuantumProtocol
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The `requirements.txt` file should contain the following dependencies (or their equivalent versions):

    ```
    cryptography==41.0.7
    pytest==7.4.4
    numpy==1.26.3
    networkx==3.2.1
    matplotlib==3.8.2
    ```

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use the QuantumProtocol library:

**1. Implementing a simplified Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus:**

```python
from quantumprotocol.consensus import ProofOfWork

# Initialize PoW with a difficulty level
pow = ProofOfWork(difficulty=4)

# Example block data
data = "Transaction data: Send 10 coins to Bob"

# Find a valid hash for the block
nonce = pow.mine_block(data)

# Verify the block's hash
is_valid = pow.validate_block(data, nonce)

print(f"Nonce: {nonce}")
print(f"Block is valid: {is_valid}")
```

**2. Simulating a simple blockchain network:**

```python
from quantumprotocol.network import BlockchainNetwork
from quantumprotocol.consensus import ProofOfWork
from quantumprotocol.blockchain import Blockchain

# Initialize network with 5 nodes
network = BlockchainNetwork(num_nodes=5)

# Create a genesis block
genesis_block_data = "Genesis Block"
genesis_block = network.nodes[0].blockchain.create_genesis_block(genesis_block_data)

# Add a new block to the first node's blockchain
new_block_data = "Transaction: Alice sends 5 coins to Charlie"
new_block = network.nodes[0].blockchain.add_block(new_block_data)

# Propagate the new block to other nodes in the network
network.propagate_block(new_block)

# Verify that all nodes have the same blockchain length (after propagation)
blockchain_lengths = [len(node.blockchain.chain) for node in network.nodes]
print(f"Blockchain lengths across nodes: {blockchain_lengths}")
```

**3. Analyzing the performance of Proof-of-Stake (PoS):**

```python
from quantumprotocol.consensus import ProofOfStake
import time

# Initialize Proof-of-Stake with an initial stake distribution
stakes = {
    "Node1": 100,
    "Node2": 50,
    "Node3": 25
}
pos = ProofOfStake(stakes=stakes)

# Simulate block creation and validation over time
start_time = time.time()
for i in range(100):
    validator = pos.select_validator()
    data = f"Block {i} data"
    signature = pos.sign_block(data, validator)
    is_valid = pos.verify_block(data, signature, validator)

end_time = time.time()
elapsed_time = end_time - start_time

print(f"Simulated 100 blocks in {elapsed_time:.4f} seconds")
```

These examples demonstrate the basic usage of the QuantumProtocol library.  More detailed examples and documentation can be found in the `examples/` directory.
